## Status: In progress

This project is not yet functional.

## Installation

Please note that zip/unzip and [node 11.x](https://nodejs.org) or above are required.

eurostar2gtfs is a CLI tool that can be installed via NPM:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs zip
npm install -g eurostar2gtfs
```

## Usage

It can be run by specifying the input and output files as CLI arguments:

```

```

## Notes

There is an [example of the text format](timetable.txt) in the repository. It is a close copy of the [PDF timetable](https://content-static.eurostar.com/documents/446099_Timetables%20Core%20destination_Issue%2082_UK%20EN_0.pdf). The dates require some manual editing into one of the following formats:

 * 1 Runs from 31 March 2019
 * 2 Runs between 6 April 2019 and 20 April 2019. Runs on 4 May 2019.
 * 3 Runs between 6 January 2019 and 2 February 2019, not running 20 January 2019, not running 21 January 2019
 * 4 Runs until 30 March 2019. Runs between 25 May 2019 and 1 June 2019

Please note:
  
* Where only a from date is specified the to date is assumed to be the end date specified at the top of the page
* Where only a to date is specified the from date is assumed to be the start date specified at the top of the page
* All dates must have the year added to them
* A full stop `.` denotes separate calendar date ranges. Using the examples above all journeys with calendar 4 will have two GTFS calendars   
* Indirect services are not yet implemented
